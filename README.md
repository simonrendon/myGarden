# myGarden
myGarden is a Python CLI application that I developed using Python 3.9 and the SQLite 3 database framework. It consists of an SQLite database of many different plants, and allows users to create their own gardens, compare the size of their gardens with others, and provides many different tools for navigating the relational database.
